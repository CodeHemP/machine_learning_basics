# Machine learning basics

This repository contains implementations of basic machine learning algorithms in plain Python (Python Version 3.5+). All algorithms are implemented from scratch without using additional machine learning libraries. The intention of these notebooks is to provide a basic understanding of the algorithms and their underlying structure, *not* to provide the most efficient implementations.

## Note

If you want print "Hello, Amusi! I am Lucy", you need concern the follow syntax in Python3.6 and Python3.5.

**Python3.6 New Characteris:**

```python
name1 = "Amusi"
name2 = "Lucy"
print(f"Hello, {name2}! I am {name1}.")
```

**Python3.5:**

```
name1 = "Amusi"
name2 = "Lucy"
print("Hello, {0}! I am {1}.".format(name2, name1))
```
